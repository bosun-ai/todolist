// jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)

/**
 * This file configures the Jest testing environment to use custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom`,
 * enhancing the testing capabilities for DOM nodes within React applications.
 *
 * By importing `@testing-library/jest-dom`, it provides the project with a set of extended assertions
 * that are more descriptive and readable compared to the default Jest matchers. This is particularly
 * beneficial for testing UI components, allowing developers to write clearer, more expressive tests.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```typescript
 * // In a test file
 * expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i);
 * // This assertion checks if the specified element contains text content that matches the /react/i regex,
 * // demonstrating the enhanced readability and expressiveness of tests using `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Utilize the custom matchers to write descriptive and accurate test cases.
 * - Keep tests organized and structured consistently for maintainability.
 * - Regularly review and update tests to incorporate new features or best practices from `@testing-library/jest-dom` and Jest.
 *
 * Integration with CI/CD:
 * The setup in this file supports the CI/CD process, particularly in automated testing steps with GitHub Actions,
 * ensuring that all tests pass before any code is deployed. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining high-quality,
 * reliable test suites for the application.
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * Efficient test writing is crucial to prevent performance bottlenecks, especially in complex React applications.
 * Developers are encouraged to focus on writing tests that are both comprehensive and efficient, balancing coverage
 * with test execution time.
